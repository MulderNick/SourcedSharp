# SourcedSharp
SourcedSharp aims to be a fully functional Event Sourcing framework for c# which is scalable and straightforward to use.

It is currently in an early state. However, if everything works out as planned, it should become a fully functional open source basis for many projects.

Feedback is welcome

# ToDo:
- # Add proper gitignore!!!!!!
- Add Tests when framework structure has taken shape
- Move example projects to separate repo's.
- Add more documentation
