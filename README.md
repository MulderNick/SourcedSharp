# SourcedSharp
SourcedSharp aims to be a fully functiontonional Event Sourcing framework for c#. It aims to be scalable, secure and most of all straightforward to use.

It is currently in a really early state and more of a personal project. However, if everything works out as planned, it should become a fully functional open source basis for many projects.

I'm looking forward any tips, whishes or feedback
