# SourcedSharp
SourcedSharp aims to be a fully functional Event Sourcing framework for c# which is scalable, secure and straightforward to use.

It is currently in an early state. However, if everything works out as planned, it should become a fully functional open source basis for many projects.

I'm looking forward to any feedback
